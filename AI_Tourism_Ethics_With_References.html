    <h2>1. My Profession and Technology Use</h2>
    <img class="img-banner" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1549921296-3ecf47f6c31c" alt="Tourism AI Technology">
    <p>I'm getting ready for a future job as a Customer Experience Specialist in the tourism industry. Without modern tourism, artificial Intelligence does also cannot happen. Companies use AI system for:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Collection and analysis of customer information</li>
        <li>Generate personalised travel recommendations</li>
        <li>Predict traveller's preference and behavior</li>
        <li>Provide 24/7 chatbot customer service</li>
        <li>Help manager make decision with lots of data</li>
        <li>Tailor dynamic pricing and promotion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>New findings show that AI-human teamwork alters tourism administration, yet it needs great responsibility and transparency (Guo et al., 2026).</p>

    <p>As travellers become more digital, personal information is being generated at an increasing rate, leading to serious concerns over privacy, data governance, vulnerability (Yallop et al., 2023).</p>

    <p>So professional practice in tourism now includes digital skill and ethical literacy when working with an ai.</p>

    <h2>2. My Ethical Dilemma</h2>
    <img class="img-banner" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1605902711622-cfb43c44367d" alt="Data Leak Warning">
    <p>My simulated workplace has a personalization system from the tourism company that uses AI to recommend destinations, hotels, and things to do based on customer data. The system leaked out big data recently. Customers reported:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Hacked email accounts</li>
        <li>phone numb ers used f or sc am cal ls an d spam mess age s</li>
        <li>Stolen bank information to make fake payment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But still, the headquarters would refuse both halt and to change the system. They said “data leaks is normal in this industry” and insisted that the system was still in accordance with internal policies.</p>

    <p>I am an employee, I can't disable the AI tool, I have no control over the customer. I have to keep working with something where customers are in danger.</p>

    <p>It causes an ethical conflict between what the company wants, keeping customers safe, and my own personal feelings about it. Tourism researchers claim that these sorts of tensions are normal since the front-line staff usually experience the effects of organisational choices and authority disparities (Lapointe et al., 2026).</p>

    <h2>3. Ethical Implications</h2>
    <img class="img-banner" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526378722484-c5f9a5f6b6e9" alt="Ethical Issues">
    <p>AI-related data leaks cause lots of morals at different levels of the tourism system.</p>

    <h3>A. Effects on Customers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lack of privacy and lack of control of personal data</li>
        <li>Financial hurt because of fraud or swiped banking information</li>
        <li>more worries, more anger, not believe</li>
        <li>Willingness to use digital tourism platform reduced</li>
        <li>Gen Z travellers are more concerned with ethical tourism practices, Seyfi et al., 2025.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Effects on Employees</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Customer emotional stress caused by interacting with angry or worrie d customers</li>
        <li>Moral Distress Due to Company Policies vs. Moral Judgment</li>
        <li>Lowered senses of professional integrity and identification (Lapointe et al., 2026)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>C. Effects on the Organisation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>longtime branding damage and loss of customer loyalty</li>
        <li>Faced with legal consequences from privacy law</li>
        <li>Misalignment between the company’s public ethical image and its actual practices (Guo et al., 2026; Manthiou & Kuppelwieser, 2025)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>D. On tourism industry</h3>
    <p>Scholarship on tourism ethics highlights the fact that there are system effects from doing unethical things as they impact trust, justice, sustainability across the sector, Guia & Marlisa, 2023, Tomazos, 2025)</p>

    <p>Large data breaches damage people’s confidence in AI tourism and increase calls for more strict regulation.</p>

    <h2>4. How to deal with the trouble</h2>
    <img class="img-banner" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522071820081-009f0129c71c" alt="Solutions Action">
    <p>Although I don't know how to redesign the AI system, I can at least use ethical thinking and computational thinking to reduce harm.</p>

    <h3>1. Transparent Communication</h3>
    <p>i can give customers clear info on safe digital behavior, urge them to share less unnecessary data, and show them how to spot phishers.</p>
    <p>Transparency is important for ethical data governance (Yallop et al., 2023).</p>

    <h3>2. Customer Education</h3>
    <p>I can prepare a short digital safety guide telling:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Secure passwords</li>
        <li>Two-factor authentication</li>
        <li>Find suspicious messages</li>
        <li>Steps to report fraud</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Educating travelers increases travelers ethical awareness and makes travelers less vulnerable. ( Seyfi et al,. 2025)</p>

    <h3>3. Internal Reporting Using Evidence</h3>
    <p>I can systematically document:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Customer complaints</li>
        <li>Fraud cases</li>
        <li>Patterns of suspicious activity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>then use your computing thinking to analyse and report these results back to the management</p>
    <p>Data-driven reporting supports accountability and responsible AI use(Guo, E., et al., 2026).</p>

    <h3>4. Offering Ethical Alternatives</h3>
    <p>Wherever I can, I will give my customer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manual travel planning</li>
        <li>Non-personalised recommendations</li>
        <li>"AI-FREE" options for privacy conscious travelers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Respects travellers' choices around what with their data (Yallop et al., 2023).</p>

    <h3>5. Promoting Ethical Organisational Culture</h3>
    <p>I can advocate for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular cybersecurity audits</li>
        <li>Clear data-handling guidelines</li>
        <li>Training ethically for AI staff</li>
        <li>Create an internally-focused AI Ethics group</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tourism ethics research emphasizes structural and cultural change over individual actions (Manthiou & Kuppelwieser, 2025; Yuan et al., 2023).</p>

    <h2>5. Professional code of ethics</h2>
    <img class="img-banner" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581090464761-94502e28706b" alt="Ethical Standards">
    <p>Also this is about the core problems of tourism professionals' morals:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Privacy</strong><br>Customers have the right to handle personal information in a safe manner (Yallop et al., 2023)</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity & Honesty</strong><br>Withholding risk information goes against professionals being honest (Guia & Marlisa, 2023).</li>
        <li><strong>Fairness & Justice</strong><br>When there’s a data leak, vulnerable customers get hit hard, leading to questions about power and equality (Lapointe et al., 2026).</li>
        <li><strong>Responsibility</strong><br>Tourism professionals have to step in and prevent harms and to help foster ethical and sustainable innovation (Manthiou & Kuppelwieser, 2025).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By analyzing the dilemma and developing real solutions to it, this website represents responsible AI use in my future workplace for me and my colleagues, and gives them an understanding of real risk of ethics with technology.</p>
